Hello!

Welcome to my GitHub profile. The purpose of this profile is to showcase my knowledge and skills through my projects. I have a passion for all aspects of IT and a drive to continuously improve my skillsets.

My current interest is in web application development using PHP, JavaScript, and MySQL. While my projects currently do not use frameworks (just straight code), I plan on converting everything to work with frameworks such as AngularJS, Laravel, Node.js, and Vue.js.

I am a hands-on learner, and I am really looking forward to collaborating through this platform.
